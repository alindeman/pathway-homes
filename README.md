## Development

The `bootstrap` script is meant to setup your environment in one step. Run it
from the Terminal:

```
script/bootstrap
```

Start the server and load up <http://localhost:3000>:

```
script/server
```

In development, a default user is created with email <admin@example.com> and
password `password`.

### Deployment

Production is hosted at <https://pathway-homes.herokuapp.com>. To deploy,
commit your changes, push to master, then:

```
script/deploy
```
